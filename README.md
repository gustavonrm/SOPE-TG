# SOPE-Trab02

>Baby, can't you see <br />
I'm calling<br />
A guy like you should wear a warning<br />
It's dangerous<br />
I'm falling<br /><br />
There's no escape<br />
I can't wait<br />
I need a hit<br />
Baby, give me it<br />
You're dangerous<br />
I'm loving it<br /><br />
Too high<br />
Can't come down<br />
Losin' my head<br />
Spinnin' 'round and 'round<br />
Do you feel me now?<br /><br />
Oh, <br />
The taste of your lips<br />
I'm on a ride<br />
You're toxic I'm slippin' under<br />
With a taste of a poison paradise<br /><br />
I'm addicted to you<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br />
And I love what you do<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br /><br />
It's getting late <br />
To give you up<br />
I took a sip <br />
From my devil's cup<br />
Slowly, it's taking over me<br /><br />
Too high <br />
Can't come down<br />
It's in the air and it's all around<br />
Can you feel me now?<br /><br />
Oh, <br />
Taste of your lips<br />
I'm on a ride<br />
You're toxic I'm slippin' under<br />
With the taste of a poison paradise<br /><br />
I'm addicted to you<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br />
And I love what you do<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br /><br />
Taste of your lips<br />
I'm on a ride<br />
You're toxic I'm slippin' under<br />
With a taste of a poison paradise<br /><br />
I'm addicted to you<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br /><br />
With the taste of your lips<br />
I'm on a ride<br />
You're toxic I'm slippin' under<br />
With a taste of the poison paradise<br /><br />
I'm addicted to you<br />
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br /><br />
Intoxicate me now<br />
With your lovin' now<br />
I think I'm ready now<br />
I think I'm ready now<br /><br />
Intoxicate me now<br />
With your lovin' now<br />
I think I'm ready now<br /><br />
